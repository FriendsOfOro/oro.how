If you came here, you are probably a developer searching for information about *OroPlatform*, an environment for building Business Applications. We will try to help you through a set of articles on how to handle your development through *OroPlatform* and its derived applications.

## What is OroPlatform ?

OroPlatform is a set of [Symfony][symfony] bundles handling for you the basic needs for a business application, such as user management, data storage, data import & export, API infrastructure, UI components, data intelligence, etc.

OroPlatform is developed by [Oro, Inc.][oroinc], a Californian company on which the company builds two business applications:
* [OroCRM][orocrm], a Customer Relationship Manager application
* [OroCommerce][orocommerce], a B2B e-commerce application built for complex use cases and business-to-business sales

## Alternatives to OroPlatform

* Standard *Symfony* full-stack: One of the obvious alternatives to OroPlatform would be to use a basic full-stack Symfony application. For simple use cases where you won't need complex features, or when your use cases are too distant from what OroPlatform offers, it is probably the best choice.
* *API Platform*: Another obvious alternatives to OroPlatform is API Platform. For API-only applications, or headless applications, you may choose this option.
